          Welcome to the Self-Improvement HUB â€” a centralized space designed to help you stay consistent with your personal growth. Whether you're tracking fitness challenges, building daily habits, or working toward long-term goals, this platform is built to keep you focused and motivated. I created this app out of a need for a simple, organized way to measure progress and hold myself accountable without feeling overwhelmed. It's about progress, not perfection.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          In the future, I plan to add features like daily reflection prompts, AI-powered habit suggestions, and integrations with tools like Google Fit and Apple Health. My goal is to make self-improvement more visual, more structured, and ultimately more achievable for anyone on a growth journey.
